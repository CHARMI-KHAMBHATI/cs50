0.How many different colors does each format support?
BMP: 32 bit color, or over 4 billion.
GIF: 8 bits, 256 colors.
JPEG: 24 bit, 16 million.
PNG: 24 bit, 16 million.

1.Which of the formats supports animation?
GIF format

2.What’s the difference between lossy and lossless compression?
With lossless compression, every single bit of data that was originally in the file remains after the file is uncompressed. 
lossy compression reduces a file by permanently eliminating certain information,
especially redundant information.
When the file is uncompressed, only a part of the original information is still there 

3.Which of these formats is lossy-compressed?
JPG, JPEG.

4.What happens, technically speaking, when a file is deleted on a FAT file system?
    1. The system modifies the filename's first character to signal that it has
       been deleted and that the directory entry can be recycled.
       (Most OSs simply remove the file's reference from the containing dir.)
    2. The system moves all of the file's FAT clusters to the hard drive's list
       of free clusters.
       The file's data is never touched.

5.What can someone like you do to ensure (with high probability) that files you delete cannot be recovered?
Write NUL bytes (or random characters) to every address on the disk.
There's consensus that "overwriting a disk with a few random passes" is 
sufficient.

6. What’s stdint.h?
A bunch of typedefs and macros for making integer variables of custom sizes.

7. What’s the point of using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t in a
program?
We can fill up exactly the amount of space you want in a file which is good
for things like bitmap headers.

8. How many bytes is a BYTE, a DWORD, a LONG, and a WORD, respectively?
BYTE = 8 bits = 1 byte
DWORD= 32 bits = 4 bytes
LONG = signed 32 bits = 4 bytes
WORD = 16 bits = 2 bytes

9. What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any
BMP file be? (Leading bytes used to identify file formats (with high
probability) are generally called "magic numbers.)"
Hex:    0x424d
ASCII:  BM (bitmap!)
This value is stored in "bfType".

10. What’s the difference between bfSize and biSize?
bfSize is the total number of bytes in the file (246 for smiley.bmp).
biSize is the number of bytes in the info header (40 for a bitmap).

11. What does it mean if biHeight is negative?
For uncompressed RGB bitmaps, if biHeight is positive, the bitmap is a bottom-
up DIB with the origin at the lower left corner. If biHeight is negative, the
bitmap is a top-down DIB with the origin at the upper left corner.

12. What field in BITMAPINFOHEADER specifies the BMP’s color depth (i.e., bits
per pixel)?
biBitCount.

13. Why might fopen return NULL in copy.c:37?
If it can't find the file, it will.

14. Why is the third argument to fread always 1 in our code?
Because it specifies how many elements you want to read, and we're always
reading a struct so we only need 1 struct.

15. What value does copy.c:70 assign padding if bi.biWidth is 3?
The padding would be 3, because 3 pixels * 3 bytes per pixel * 3 padding = 12,
which is a multiple of 4.

16. What does fseek do?
It moves to a specific location in a file.

17. What is SEEK_CUR?
An integer constant which, when used as the 'whence' argument to the
fseek or fseeko function, specifies that the offset provided is relative to
the current file position.
